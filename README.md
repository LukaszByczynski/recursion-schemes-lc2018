# Recursion schemes without the barbed wire

Welcome to AcmeCorp®! We are so happy we just hired a whole team of motivated engineers. Here at AcmeCorp®, we are proud proponents of statically-typed functional programming on the JVM — well, basically we use Scala.

On your first day at work, we have a good news and a bad news. The good news is: we have an exciting new mission, our most important client has tasked us with the construction of its "meta data lake", whatever that means. The bad news is they want it live by tonight.

But fear not, out architects hqve already designed the whole system and it works like a charm (on Powerpoint). All you need to do is to follow the specs and write a few Scala lines.

## Before we begin

You'll need to fulfill a few requirements in order to get everything work. You'll need to install 

* Java8 JDK
* sbt

Everything else should be pretty much work out of the box. This project has a few external dependencies though, so in order to save everyone some network bandwidth, it would be cool if you manage to clone the repository and issue the `sbt update` command in advance of the workshop.

## Structure of the workshop

This workshop is made of a series of prectical exercises, interleaved with a bunch of useful explanations about specific recursion schemes, patterns and techniques. Each exercise lives in its own git branch and a solution to each exercise is available in another branch with the `-solution` suffix.
